Welcome to the ReactJS Article Summarizer Application! This application aims to transform lengthy articles into clear and concise summaries using OpenAI's GPT model. It is built using Vite as the project setup tool and utilizes Tailwind CSS to create a responsive and beautiful UI/UX with a touch of glass morphism. Advanced Redux Toolkit (RTK) is used to handle API requests that fire conditionally. The application also includes features like saving URL summary history using local storage, handling form events, catching errors, and implementing copy to clipboard functionality.
